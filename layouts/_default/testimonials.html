    <p class="testimonialsSubTitle">&quot;It was a great experience. There are no more leaks or weird creaking noises anymore.&quot;</p>
  <p>"I got my roof renovated because there were leaks and cracks all over the place. My house is old so it was about time to get things fixed. C-STAR has been in business for 25 years and that's evident through the service they provide. I discussed my problems with them and we set a date for them to come in and start working. They were fifteen minutes early on and did a fabulous job. It was a great experience."<br />

  <p class="testimonialsSubTitle">"Fixed my leaking roof under the 10 years warranty"</p>
  <p>"C-Star did the roofing for my house a few years ago. The warranty is for 10 years. A few days ago, the weather was bad and the wind has blown away a few shingles from my roof and water has leaked into one of my bedrooms' door frame. I called C-Star this morning and in the afternoon they have already sent somebody to my house and fixed my roof which is covered under the 10 years warranty. An amazing speedy same day service!"<br />

  <p class="testimonialsSubTitle">"Wow! I now have the roof for about four months and have been very happy with the work"</p>
  <p>"I called a small number of roofers for estimates to replace my roof. Most of them wanted two weeks before coming for an estimate. Sam (Owner of C-star) came from Scarborough to Mississauga that same day and gave a clearly defined quote/statement of work with pictures. After a couple of days to think about it, I called Sam to proceed with the roof. He asked for $100 deposit and the shingles showed up two days later and his team came about two weeks later (as promised) to replace the roof. The team showed up at 4pm on Sunday afternoon and I thought oh great... he's going to leave the roof undone for a day. I was shocked when they stripped the old roof, laid the paper and install the shingles and cleaned up by 6:10pm. Wow! I now have the roof for about four months and have been very happy with the work. Great work Sam!"<br />
